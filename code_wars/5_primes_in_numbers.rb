# Given a positive number n > 1 find the prime factor decomposition of n.
# The result will be a string with the following form :

# "(p1**n1)(p2**n2)...(pk**nk)"

# with the p(i) in increasing order and n(i) empty if n(i) is 1.

# Example of Division Method for Prime Factorization:

# Below is a detailed step-by-step process of prime factorization by taking 460 as an example.

      # Step 1: Divide 460 by the least prime number i.e. 2.
      #           So, 460 รท 2 = 230

      # Step 2: Again Divide 230 with the least prime number (which is again 2).
      #           Now, 160 รท 2 = 115

      # Step 3: Divide again with the least prime number which will be 5.
      #           So, 115 รท 5 = 23

      # Step 4: As 23 is a prime number, divide it with itself to get 1.
      #           Now, the prime factors of 460 will be 2**2 x 5 x 23

      # Example: n = 86240 should return "(2**5)(5)(7**2)(11)"

# input: integer
# output: string
# rules:
  # input greater than 1
# algorithm:
  # create a prime helper method

  # create a helper method lowest prime
    # iterate from 2..num / 2 - for each n
      # return n if num is divisible by n and n is prime

  # main method
    # create results hash(Hash.new(0))
    # in a loop:
      # find lowest prime number that int is divisible by
      # divide it and reassign num to remainder, push divisor and number of divisions into hash
      # break when num is prime
  # return hash data as a string in prescribed format
